This is a simple Streamlit web application that predicts the next word in a given text sequence using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model was trained on a custom text dataset and uses a tokenizer to preprocess input text. When a user enters a sentence, the app predicts the most likely next word based on learned patterns. It's designed for educational and demonstration purposes, featuring a clean UI and real-time inference.
